# Predicting-ADHD-in-women
Building a model to predict both an individualâ€™s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information.
The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. It thus symmetrically represents both precision and recall in one metric. The highest possible value of an F-score is 1.0, indicating perfect precision and recall, and the lowest possible value is 0, if precision and recall are zero.
